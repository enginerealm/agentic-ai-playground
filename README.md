# agentic-ai-playground
A hands-on journey into Agentic AI â€” building autonomous, tool-using, and goal-driven agents.

This is my personal exploration space for learning and building in the world of Agentic AI. From autonomous decision-making to tool-using agents and multi-agent systems, this repo captures my ongoing journey, experiments, and projects as I dive deeper into the art and engineering of intelligent, agentic systems.
